# Softball-Swing-Master
This repository holds my final project for DGMD S-14's Summer 2020 class.
The project is an activity classifier for baseball/softball swings, with a focus on a player's back leg's pivot in their swing.
This classifier seeks to differentiate between four different patterns in back leg pivots: a good swing, little pivot, wild pivot, and picking up the back leg when swinging.
These three different common errors in swings have detrimental effects on a player's batting abilities, so this classifier seeks to prevent said bad habits.
Additionally, this project seeks to flatten the steep learning curve that many beginner baseball/softball players face when attempting to learn the sport; my goal is to make the sport that I love dearly more accessible to those looking in from outside.
